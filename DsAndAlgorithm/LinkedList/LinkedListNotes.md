# what is Linked List?

Array is of fixed length.
Array is stored in the heap memory in contiguous location.
Array is easy to traverse with index.
We cannot increase or decrease the size of the array.

## Linked List


This where LinkedList comes.
Linked List can increase or decrease its length.
Linked List are stored in the heap memory but not in contiguous memory location.
Hence we can easily increase or decrease the size of the Linked List.
We cannot traverse with index.

Each node contains data and pointer to the next node.
Head Node and Tail Node

Starting point of the linked list is called Head

In Linked List for any method we always return the head 



## Use case 


1.Stack 
2.Queue
3.Browser Navigation (Doubly Linked List)



## Data Type for Implementing Linked List

Custom / Self defined data type 

Class ----> JavaScript, Java 
Struct----> C
