## Single Responsibility Principle

Class should have single responsibility. </br>
Class should have a single reason to change. 
</br>


```mermaid 
classDiagram
    Invoice ..|> Marker : Invoice has a Marker
    class Marker{
        +name;
        +color;
        +year;
        +price;
    }
    class Invoice{
        -Marker marker
        -calculateTotal()
        -printInvoice()
        -saveToDb()
    }
```

</br>
</br>

``` javascript
class Marker {
  name;
  color;
  year;
  price;

  constructor(name, color, year, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.year = year;
    this.price = price;
  }
}
```

```javascript
class Invoice {
  marker;
  quantity;

  constructor(marker, quantity) {
    this.marker = marker;
    this.quantity = quantity;
  }

  calculateTotal() {
    price = this.marker.price * this.quantity;
    return price;
  }

  printInvoice() {
    // print the invoice
  }

  saveToDb() {
    // Save data to DB
  }
}
```
</br>

#### The Invoice Class can change for 3 reasons: 
1. calculateTotal()
2. printInvoice() 
3. saveToDb()
   

#### Invoice Class does not follow Single Responsibility Principle
